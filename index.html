  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This website documents my eco-column project, a contained ecosystem designed to model how living organisms
    interact with each other and with Earth systems. The eco-column includes both aquatic and terrestrial
    components and demonstrates ecological principles from Units 1–4.
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Ecosystem Type:</strong> Freshwater pond and forest-floor hybrid ecosystem
  </div>
</section>

<section id="unit1">
  <h2>Unit 1: The Living World – Ecosystems</h2>
  <h3>Energy Flow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Producers:</strong> Aquatic algae, grass, and small leafy plants</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Consumers:</strong> Snails and small aquatic organisms</li>
    <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> Bacteria and fungi in the soil</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Energy enters the eco-column through sunlight. Producers convert light energy into chemical energy via
    photosynthesis. Consumers obtain energy by feeding on producers, and decomposers recycle nutrients back
    into the soil.
  </p>

  <h3>Biogeochemical Cycles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carbon Cycle:</strong> Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and released through respiration and decomposition.</li>
    <li><strong>Nitrogen Cycle:</strong> Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil convert nitrogen into usable forms for plants.</li>
    <li><strong>Phosphorus Cycle:</strong> Phosphates from soil minerals are absorbed by plant roots and returned through waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrologic Cycle:</strong> Water evaporates, condenses on the container walls, and returns as precipitation.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="unit2">
  <h2>Unit 2: The Living World – Biodiversity</h2>
  <p>
    Biodiversity within the eco-column increases stability and resilience. Each species plays a specific role
    in maintaining ecosystem balance.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Provide oxygen, food, and habitat</li>
    <li><strong>Snails:</strong> Control algae growth and recycle nutrients</li>
    <li><strong>Microorganisms:</strong> Break down waste and dead matter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each organism was selected based on its ecological tolerance to moisture, light, and limited space.
    Introducing an invasive species could disrupt balance by outcompeting native organisms or increasing waste
    beyond the system’s capacity.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="unit3">
  <h2>Unit 3: Populations</h2>
  <p>
    The population of snails was observed over several weeks. Population size remained stable due to limited
    food availability and space.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Estimated Population Size:</strong> 5–7 snails</li>
    <li><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong> Determined by algae growth and oxygen levels</li>
    <li><strong>Limiting Factors:</strong> Food supply, waste accumulation, and space</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the population exceeded carrying capacity, algae would decline and water quality would decrease,
    leading to population reduction.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="unit4">
  <h2>Unit 4: Earth Systems & Resources</h2>
  <h3>Abiotic Components</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Layered with gravel, sand, and nutrient-rich topsoil to support roots and drainage</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Dechlorinated freshwater to support aquatic life</li>
    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Natural sunlight simulates daily energy input</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The soil’s cation exchange capacity allows it to retain nutrients, while water movement supports nutrient
    transport. Heat absorbed by darker soil layers slightly increases temperature, mimicking real Earth
    surface processes.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This eco-column successfully models a real-world ecosystem on a small scale. By integrating biological
    diversity, population dynamics, energy flow, and Earth systems, the project demonstrates how interconnected
    and balanced ecosystems must be to remain sustainable.
